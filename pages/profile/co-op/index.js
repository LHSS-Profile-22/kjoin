          Software development (including QA) was the most popular sector
          for our cohort in every round, similar to the SYDE 2024 Cohort [1].

          The majority of people without parents working in a STEM position 
          secured a job during the continuous round.
          Compared to those with parents in STEM, there is a large disparity 
          with people getting jobs in earlier rounds.
