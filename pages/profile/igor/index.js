            Dr. Igor Ivkovic was a Systems Design Engineering professor who taught us during our 1A term. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Affectionately known as Igor by his students, he was known for being incredibly sympathetic and kind. 
            His passion was teaching, and he dedicated his life to his family and students. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            His office hours were never ending, with him always being available to answer questions, or just talk. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            On the 27th of November 2020, Dr. Igor Ivkovic tragically passed away at the age of 43. 
            Igor was a kind soul with a heart of gold who changed the lives of everyone he touched, and he will be dearly missed.
            <br></br>

              Kindness is an ember that glows deep inside us
              <br></br>
              It gives us warmth when the world around us may be cold
              <br></br>
              It gives us energy to share the warmth to those in need
              <br></br>
              The ember will glow as long as our spirit is alive
              <br></br>
